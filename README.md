# ⚡ EDA & Energy Optimization System

This project leverages **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Statistical Hypothesis Testing** to analyze energy consumption patterns, optimize resource usage, and identify cost-saving opportunities.

## 🔍 Key Features

### 📊 Data-Driven Insights

Perform in-depth **EDA** to uncover trends, anomalies, and correlations in energy consumption across different regions and time intervals.

### 🔬 Statistical Hypothesis Testing

Validate key assumptions by applying statistical tests, such as **ANOVA, correlation analysis, and t-tests**, to assess the impact of **region and time of day** on energy consumption.

### 💰 Cost Optimization & Threshold Analysis

Determine the **optimal threshold** for shutting down low-consumption cells to reduce energy waste. Estimate the **potential cost savings (in KW and EGP)** using different pricing tiers (High, Normal, Low).

### 📧 Automated Reports & Notifications

Generate **automated reports** summarizing energy trends, anomalies, and optimization recommendations. 📈🔍
